To convert the provided entity-relationship model (ER model) into a relational diagram, we need to identify the entities, their attributes, and the relationships based on the image you referenced.

Entities and Attributes:
Hotel

Attributes:
Hotel_ID (Primary Key)
Name
Location
Rating
Room

Attributes:
Room_ID (Primary Key)
Room_Number
Type
Price
Hotel_ID (Foreign Key referencing Hotel)
Customer

Attributes:
Customer_ID (Primary Key)
First_Name
Last_Name
Phone
Email
Reservation

Attributes:
Reservation_ID (Primary Key)
Start_Date
End_Date
Room_ID (Foreign Key referencing Room)
Customer_ID (Foreign Key referencing Customer)
Relationships:
Hotel - Room: One hotel can have many rooms (1 to N relationship).
Room - Reservation: A room can have multiple reservations, and each reservation pertains to one room (1 to N relationship).
Customer - Reservation: A customer can make multiple reservations, but each reservation is made by one customer (1 to N relationship).
Relational Diagram:
Based on the above information, here is the relational diagram:

Hotel (Hotel_ID, Name, Location, Rating)
Room (Room_ID, Room_Number, Type, Price, Hotel_ID)
Customer (Customer_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Phone, Email)
Reservation (Reservation_ID, Start_Date, End_Date, Room_ID, Customer_ID)
Summary of Foreign Keys:
Room references Hotel via Hotel_ID.
Reservation references Room via Room_ID.
Reservation references Customer via Customer_ID.
This relational diagram effectively captures the relationships and attributes described in the entity-relationship model. You can now use this structure to create a database schema for managing hotel data.
